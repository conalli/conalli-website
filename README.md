This is the repository for my personal website, you can find it at www.conalli.info.
This project was built using a combination of TypeScript, React, SASS and Framer-Motion using the Vite build tool.

If you have any comments or questions for me, feel free to message me via the contact section of the site, or via social media and I'll get back to you ASAP.
